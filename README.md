# Project Title

BASIC_PROJECT

## Overview

This project was initiated for educational purposes. While it remains unfinished and unpolished much like many educational projects there is still hope that one day I will complete what I have started (though, let's be honest, it's probably not going to happen ðŸ˜ƒ).

## Project Goals

The primary aim of this project was to gain practical knowledge and build a basic functional Java application that includes:

- User registration
- Email confirmation
- User login

Additionally, I implemented:

- JWT authentication
- A microservice for file upload/download
- PDF generation capabilities

## Usage

If you find this project interesting and have intentions of using it for your next-gen unicorn startup, feel free to do so!
